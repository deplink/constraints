Extends JSON format with custom keys containing additional data (called constraints). Purpose of this library is to change JSON value depending on the user context (e.g. getting scripts to execute when we're on x86 or x64 architecture).

See [documentation](https://deplink.org/docs/guide/constraints#additional-constraints) and [provided tests](tests/JsonTest.php) for more information.
